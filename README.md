# Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock Price Movement

This repository contains Python code for performing Monte Carlo simulations to model the movement of stock prices. Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful technique for understanding the range of possible outcomes in financial markets, taking into account factors such as mean return and volatility.

## Features

- Generates simulated trajectories of stock prices based on specified parameters.
- Allows customization of mean return, volatility, time horizon, and number of simulations.
- Plots visualizations of simulated stock price movements for analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate to the repository directory:


3. Run the simulation script:


4. View the generated plots to visualize the simulated stock price movements.

## Parameters

- `initial_price`: Initial stock price.
- `mean_range/drift rate`: Range of mean returns (from 1% to 10% per year).
- `std_dev_range/volatility`: Range of volatilities (from 5% to 30% per year).
- `time_horizon`: Time horizon in years.
- `num_simulations`: Number of simulation runs.
